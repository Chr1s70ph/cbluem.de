ETIT-Master is a collaborative project I contributed to during the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically for the KIT-ETIT Discord server. Through this initiative, we aimed to enhance the online experience for members, fostering a sense of community and knowledge sharing within the ETIT (Electrical Engineering and Information Technology) domain.
