I graduated from [Copernicus-Gymnasium](https://www.copernicus-gymnasium.de/) in 2020 and am currently studying Electrical Engineering at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) (KIT). Since 2021, I've been actively involved in the [student council](https://fs-etit.kit.edu), serving as its head from April to October 2024. In addition to my leadership role, I contribute as a system administrator for the council, managing our IT needs and overseeing our Discord server. 

Alongside my council work, I am a HiWi (Auxiliary Volunteer) and system administrator at KIT’s [SCC](https://scc.kit.edu)/NET department, where I help manage and support IT infrastructure. I’m passionate about technology, leadership, and fostering a strong student community.
